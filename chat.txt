13/08/2019, 10:25 am - Joshua Akangah: Good afternoon team,


I am really excited to see everyone next week Tuesday. We will begin the instructor training bright early on Wednesday morning. Please plan to arrive at Academic City by 4pm on Tuesday, August 13th to get settled in the hostel and to meet other instructors. We will begin the formal program at 8:30 AM on Wednesday, August 14th. 


As a reminder, meals and lodging will be provided throughout the camp. Please be sure to pack your own bedsheet and pillow as Academic City will not be providing those. 


I will share a formal schedule for training days on Tuesday evening along with a draft schedule for the camp.


Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions.

06/09/2019, 2:14 pm - Joshua Akangah: Yeah I don't think they're focused on ui
06/09/2019, 2:15 pm - Joshua Akangah: Because they run their algorithms in Java, and making these types of UI with Java is a little more complex so they just have a simple UI
06/09/2019, 2:15 pm - Joshua Akangah: But if they use flutter it can be cool
06/09/2019, 2:16 pm - Sebastian 💻: What did you say ? 👂🏽😏
06/09/2019, 2:16 pm - Joshua Akangah: It was Farhan who doesn't like flutter😂

08/09/2019, 4:19 am - Sebastian 💻: Ah, same happened for Bohemian rhapsody, so that doesn't mean its special
08/09/2019, 10:16 am - Joshua Akangah: Firstly, Bohemian rhapsody won a *Golden Globe* for best picture, and they won best sound of something at the Oscars too not best movie, it didn't even win anything at the Venice Film festival, which is one of the biggest movie award shows on the planet

Secondly, Joker won the *Golden Lion* at the Venice film festival, which is the highest award for a best movie, do they're in 2 different categories. The Oscars haven't come yet, but I can bet you Joker is going to win something.

Thirdly, go and read the reviews for yourself 😂

Infinity war and others can only dream of getting an Oscar not to even mention a Golden Lion 😂😂
08/09/2019, 10:16 am - Joshua Akangah: *sound of
**sound or
08/09/2019, 10:22 am - Joshua Akangah: Plus it's the first Superhero/villain movie to win the Golden Lion 😌
08/09/2019, 3:05 pm - Sebastian 💻: End game does not need that, they have a history since creation, not something an award can compare
08/09/2019, 3:07 pm - Sebastian 💻: You wanna compare an award to Avengers: Endgame finally beats Avatar to become the biggest movie of all time.
08/09/2019, 3:07 pm - Sebastian 💻: pftt
08/09/2019, 3:39 pm - Joshua Akangah: Apuu 🤣
08/09/2019, 3:39 pm - Joshua Akangah: A movie that they had to release twice to beat that record... yeah 😂😂
08/09/2019, 3:40 pm - Sebastian 💻: I dont have time for this nonsense 😂😂😂😂 First time DC has done something good see how you are happy
08/09/2019, 3:40 pm - Sebastian 💻: I am sure its because we Marvel fans see this everytime so we are used to it
08/09/2019, 3:40 pm - Joshua Akangah: Neither do I 😴
08/09/2019, 3:40 pm - Sebastian 💻: Do you know how many timees Avatar was released ?
08/09/2019, 3:41 pm - Joshua Akangah: Yeah, your movies make tons of money but aren't award worthy 🤷🏾‍♂
08/09/2019, 3:41 pm - Joshua Akangah: Educate me
08/09/2019, 3:44 pm - Sebastian 💻: Awww top Grossing of all time
08/09/2019, 3:44 pm - Sebastian 💻: DC should learn from us
08/09/2019, 3:44 pm - Joshua Akangah: Still no awards😴
08/09/2019, 3:44 pm - Sebastian 💻: I wont argue till the Joker has been released

08/09/2019, 3:48 pm - Joshua Akangah: I see no *Golden Lion* 😴
08/09/2019, 3:48 pm - Joshua Akangah: Do you know why Endgame was so big?
08/09/2019, 3:49 pm - Sebastian 💻: Because the whole world was waiting for it, duhh
08/09/2019, 3:49 pm - Sebastian 💻: You want me to go into details?
08/09/2019, 3:49 pm - Sebastian 💻: Marvel is what DC cannot be, thats why
08/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Joshua Akangah: Exactly, Marvel had built pressure over ten years, so people were eager to see how they ended Phase 3, not because it was going to be a good movie 😴
08/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Sebastian 💻: See leave me let me finish what i am doing
08/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Joshua Akangah: Running away 🤣
08/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Sebastian 💻: Do you know what makes a good movie ?
08/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Sebastian 💻: Story
08/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Sebastian 💻: Marvel built a good story for good 10 years
08/09/2019, 3:51 pm - Joshua Akangah: Endgame had a shit story 🤣
It's saving grace was just hype
08/09/2019, 3:51 pm - Sebastian 💻: Something DC can never achieve
08/09/2019, 3:51 pm - Joshua Akangah: Go and watch Joker 😴
08/09/2019, 3:51 pm - Sebastian 💻: Ill leave you to your perspective since i git to know that you have no taste for good quality movie
08/09/2019, 3:52 pm - Sebastian 💻: pftt, the trailer doesnt even move me saf
08/09/2019, 3:52 pm - Joshua Akangah: Endgame 🤮
08/09/2019, 3:52 pm - Joshua Akangah: Because you are a product of Marvel 🌚
08/09/2019, 3:52 pm - Sebastian 💻: I prefered the joker from Sucide squad wayyyyyy more
08/09/2019, 3:52 pm - Sebastian 💻: Joker💩
08/09/2019, 3:52 pm - Joshua Akangah: That Joker was a tragedy
08/09/2019, 3:53 pm - Joshua Akangah: Shit which won the Golden Lion

08/09/2019, 3:53 pm - Sebastian 💻: Probably not, you would know how many jokers exist in the DC universe
08/09/2019, 3:53 pm - Joshua Akangah: This has nothing to do with comics, Jared Leto war a horrible actor for Joker
08/09/2019, 3:54 pm - Joshua Akangah: Exactly, this Joker isn't even part of the DCEU. It's a new branch of DC movies called DC DARK
08/09/2019, 3:54 pm - Sebastian 💻: Who doesnt, Rami malik won one last year
08/09/2019, 3:55 pm - Sebastian 💻: Do you understand what you are saying ?

08/09/2019, 4:07 pm - Joshua Akangah: So where from this 😂
08/09/2019, 4:07 pm - Sebastian 💻: What defines a super hero movie?
08/09/2019, 4:08 pm - Joshua Akangah: I don't know the answer to your question 🌚
08/09/2019, 4:08 pm - Joshua Akangah: Just admit you bit your own ass in this argument 😂
08/09/2019, 4:08 pm - Sebastian 💻: Oh Joshua 🤦🏽‍♂
08/09/2019, 4:09 pm - Sebastian 💻: How can i admit, when you cant give me a simple answer?
08/09/2019, 4:10 pm - Joshua Akangah: An answer isn't necessary here. Your argument is that Joker isn't a superhero movie, I've shown you evidence that it is, what else?
08/09/2019, 4:11 pm - Sebastian 💻: Read comics, it looks like you dont know what a superhero movie is
08/09/2019, 4:11 pm - Sebastian 💻: Better still watch Marvel movies
08/09/2019, 4:11 pm - Joshua Akangah: Stop shifting the subject la. I asked a simple question, you answered, I showed evidence. Where from all these comics too?
08/09/2019, 4:11 pm - Joshua Akangah: 🤮
08/09/2019, 4:13 pm - Sebastian 💻: Kinda like saying Because the comic universe determines the Movie universe
08/09/2019, 4:13 pm - Sebastian 💻: So if you dont understand from the comics, sorry
08/09/2019, 4:15 pm - Joshua Akangah: I already said that this Joker movie is separate from what is portrayed in comics. It's not part of the DCEU we know, so comics don't affect this movie in any way. This Joker origin is different from everything the comics have made
08/09/2019, 4:15 pm - Sebastian 💻: you sure are happy to say that
08/09/2019, 4:16 pm - Joshua Akangah: Because it's true
08/09/2019, 4:19 pm - Sebastian 💻: How do you get inspiration to do slides?
08/09/2019, 4:19 pm - Sebastian 💻: trying to do some but chale, my head die
08/09/2019, 4:20 pm - Joshua Akangah: Well I just try to make the text less and put more images inside
08/09/2019, 4:21 pm - Joshua Akangah: Too much writing and people won't pay attention, so I just try to explain stuff with diagrams mostly
08/09/2019, 4:23 pm - Sebastian 💻: Oh okay
08/09/2019, 4:23 pm - Joshua Akangah: But are the slides for teaching or more like a presentation on a topic
08/09/2019, 4:24 pm - Sebastian 💻: But i am trying to do kind of like a business plan  slide
08/09/2019, 4:24 pm - Joshua Akangah: Oh okay, then yeah I think you have to balance text and diagrams to make sense out of everything
08/09/2019, 4:25 pm - Sebastian 💻: yhh, but i have no idea how
08/09/2019, 5:02 pm - Joshua Akangah: Don't worry, take your time and you'll get inspiration

04/10/2019, 11:42 pm - Sebastian 💻: Evolution from monkies, is it all humans or only Africans ?
04/10/2019, 11:42 pm - Sebastian 💻: Oh yhh, but its fucked
04/10/2019, 11:43 pm - Joshua Akangah: And not monkeys, primates. Primates are totally different
04/10/2019, 11:43 pm - Joshua Akangah: But it's facts
04/10/2019, 11:43 pm - Sebastian 💻: Awwww
04/10/2019, 11:44 pm - Joshua Akangah: Ah
04/10/2019, 11:44 pm - Sebastian 💻: Pftt 😂
04/10/2019, 11:44 pm - Sebastian 💻: When it comes to physical things I believe science
04/10/2019, 11:45 pm - Sebastian 💻: Spiritual stuff, I believe even more
04/10/2019, 11:45 pm - Sebastian 💻: Science is trying to explain the workings of God in common human understanding
04/10/2019, 11:46 pm - Sebastian 💻: I'll buy it
04/10/2019, 11:48 pm - Joshua Akangah: You can't choose oo
04/10/2019, 11:48 pm - Joshua Akangah: Most Christians always try to rubbish science
04/10/2019, 11:48 pm - Sebastian 💻: They lack understanding
04/10/2019, 11:48 pm - Joshua Akangah: Oh boys wallet make dry 😂😂
04/10/2019, 11:49 pm - Joshua Akangah: But even those with understanding do
04/10/2019, 11:48 pm - Sebastian 💻: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
04/10/2019, 11:51 pm - Sebastian 💻: How do we define those with understanding ?
04/10/2019, 11:51 pm - Joshua Akangah: I have no idea 🤷🏾‍♂
04/10/2019, 11:52 pm - Sebastian 💻: You see, why i like science is because, science explains to us the awesomeness of God
04/10/2019, 11:52 pm - Joshua Akangah: But science itself says there is no God
04/10/2019, 11:52 pm - Joshua Akangah: So why would you even believe something which tries to rubbish your religion
04/10/2019, 11:52 pm - Sebastian 💻: Science doesn't say that
04/10/2019, 11:53 pm - Sebastian 💻: Ignorant scientists do
04/10/2019, 11:53 pm - Joshua Akangah: It points to that
04/10/2019, 11:53 pm - Sebastian 💻: Because I don't blame them, I blame their ignorance
04/10/2019, 11:53 pm - Sebastian 💻: Doesn't
04/10/2019, 11:54 pm - Joshua Akangah: If religion says all life was designed and created by a supernatural being, and science says no, that all life rather evolved over billions of years due to natural selection and so on...
In a logical way, science is trying to disprove it
04/10/2019, 11:55 pm - Sebastian 💻: But you know there is not one theory on evolution
04/10/2019, 11:55 pm - Sebastian 💻: Speaking of natural selection, he do you see that ?
04/10/2019, 11:56 pm - Joshua Akangah: But others haven't been proven as much as Darwin's own
04/10/2019, 11:57 pm - Joshua Akangah: Yes, in many ways people don't know about
04/10/2019, 11:57 pm - Joshua Akangah: And besides, how old do you think the earth is?
04/10/2019, 11:58 pm - Sebastian 💻: That's the funny thing about science
04/10/2019, 11:59 pm - Sebastian 💻: Humans believe what we see and what our senses tell us
04/10/2019, 11:59 pm - Sebastian 💻: But then The Experience of Hod is more than the senses
05/10/2019, 12:01 am - Joshua Akangah: We believe what is proven
05/10/2019, 12:02 am - Joshua Akangah: There are 100s if not 1000s of religions in the world, what makes you think yours is the right one? It hasn't been proven 🤷🏾‍♂
05/10/2019, 12:02 am - Joshua Akangah: So we are only inclined to believe what we can prove
05/10/2019, 12:02 am - Sebastian 💻: Funny how science can't fully disprove the existence of God, and yet they can't prove Him
05/10/2019, 12:02 am - Sebastian 💻: The ultimate Mystery
05/10/2019, 12:03 am - Joshua Akangah: Because religion is more of a spiritual experience, which is totally out of the jurisdiction of science. Spirituality can't be proven by science
05/10/2019, 12:03 am - Sebastian 💻: Because based on what I know, they all are teaching and leading people to the enlightenment of the universe and love, but then the love that they seek is Christ
05/10/2019, 12:04 am - Sebastian 💻: Christianity is not a religion, its a relationship
05/10/2019, 12:04 am - Joshua Akangah: Nope, not all of them
05/10/2019, 12:04 am - Joshua Akangah: At the end of a day it's still a religion
05/10/2019, 12:04 am - Sebastian 💻: No its not
05/10/2019, 12:05 am - Sebastian 💻: People who took it as a religion
05/10/2019, 12:05 am - Joshua Akangah: It is
05/10/2019, 12:05 am - Sebastian 💻: Forgetting what Christ told them to do
05/10/2019, 12:06 am - Joshua Akangah: <Media omitted>
05/10/2019, 12:06 am - Sebastian 💻: Check what relationship is
05/10/2019, 12:07 am - Joshua Akangah: <Media omitted>
05/10/2019, 12:08 am - Sebastian 💻: But funny enough, Christ told us to do what the 5th explanation says
05/10/2019, 12:08 am - Sebastian 💻: That's why I said this
05/10/2019, 12:09 am - Joshua Akangah: So you're saying it's not a religion
05/10/2019, 12:09 am - Sebastian 💻: I want you to explain something to me, something the happened last week I'm my family
05/10/2019, 12:12 am - Sebastian 💻: My uncle got kidnapped, in Nigeria, and was told to pay a Ransome of $10 million, so we all had to pray and fast for God to deliver him, because we know we Dont have such amount, He got released few days after, when her got home we asked why they released him when we had not sent the money, and he said they shot him twice in his head, but it didn't hurt him, but he was watching while they killed others before him, so out of fear they sent him away
05/10/2019, 12:12 am - Sebastian 💻: Now if the Supernatural is not a real experience, I want you to explain how such things like this are possible
05/10/2019, 12:12 am - Sebastian 💻: Yes
05/10/2019, 12:13 am - Sebastian 💻: God wants us to have a relationship with Him, so we would rise above our current understanding of how things work, and to discover more
05/10/2019, 12:15 am - Joshua Akangah: That's good news
But science can explain.
There could be many things to take into account
05/10/2019, 12:15 am - Sebastian 💻: Now let's even take miracle workings and all that out of this, can you explain what happened to produce the big bang, which everything was birth out of ?
05/10/2019, 12:15 am - Joshua Akangah: I'm not a scientist, but yeah there's an explanation. Not fully though
05/10/2019, 12:16 am - Sebastian 💻: Really ? I can go on with such cases where doctors couldn't even prove what was wrong, but those people got healed from prayers
05/10/2019, 12:17 am - Joshua Akangah: You've forgotten that science can't explain everything, doesn't mean it's not explainable
Every now and then new things happen which scientists can't explain, but after research and more learning, they can explain whatever it is
05/10/2019, 12:17 am - Joshua Akangah: Science is still evolving
05/10/2019, 12:17 am - Sebastian 💻: You know science is limited to understanding things of the physical because the can't comprehend the workings of the spiritual
05/10/2019, 12:18 am - Joshua Akangah: Not because it can't comprehend, but simply because it doesn't exist
05/10/2019, 12:19 am - Sebastian 💻: That's Great, but I also want you to know that even Einstein believed in the Existence of God, it would take a man of a humble nature to understand things of the spirit
05/10/2019, 12:19 am - Sebastian 💻: To understand things as such, knowing that you have to let go of all that you are and all that you know
05/10/2019, 12:20 am - Sebastian 💻: Because even what we know is a limitation to what is to be learnt, to things that can't be proves by science
05/10/2019, 12:20 am - Sebastian 💻: *proved
05/10/2019, 12:20 am - Joshua Akangah: Of a God, not God
05/10/2019, 12:21 am - Joshua Akangah: Most people misunderstand what Einstein said
05/10/2019, 12:21 am - Sebastian 💻: I like to study science because its fascinating, looking at how everything was majestically placed, working together majestically
05/10/2019, 12:22 am - Sebastian 💻: There is but One God
05/10/2019, 12:22 am - Sebastian 💻: Really ? Then read his book, subtle is the Lord
05/10/2019, 12:23 am - Joshua Akangah: That's what Christians say
Muslims say else
Other religions say there are many
So who is right?
Because none of us have seen God, so how do you know yours is the only one?
05/10/2019, 12:24 am - Joshua Akangah: <Media omitted>
05/10/2019, 12:25 am - Sebastian 💻: I know of the Alminghty God, the Supreme God, now religions have their gods, but they all also acknowledged the existence of the Supreme God
05/10/2019, 12:26 am - Joshua Akangah: Not all
05/10/2019, 12:26 am - Joshua Akangah: And even those who do have completely different supreme gods than we Christians
05/10/2019, 12:26 am - Sebastian 💻: I can't judge his choice of not believing in the after life or some other things, the fact that someone acknowledges the existence of something or someone someone greater than them who was and is  involved in everything, is enough
05/10/2019, 12:27 am - Sebastian 💻: But also not enough, for me though
05/10/2019, 12:27 am - Joshua Akangah: Religion is complicated
05/10/2019, 12:28 am - Sebastian 💻: That is even the best part, because for me I acknowledge the existence of other gods, intact I believe in other gods, but then in the presence of other gods, Jehova is God Almighty
05/10/2019, 12:28 am - Sebastian 💻: But a relationship with God is not
05/10/2019, 12:29 am - Joshua Akangah: A relationship with God is a religion
05/10/2019, 12:29 am - Joshua Akangah: Because there's a belief in a central being
05/10/2019, 12:29 am - Joshua Akangah: And practices to that supreme being
05/10/2019, 12:29 am - Sebastian 💻: It is as clear as crystal, bringing to you the deep things of this world, to further understanding of things greater than yourself
05/10/2019, 12:30 am - Sebastian 💻: Name one practice or ritual that you think Christ told us to perform ?
05/10/2019, 12:30 am - Joshua Akangah: Communion, he said "Do this in memory of me"
05/10/2019, 12:31 am - Sebastian 💻: Is it wrong to remember someone ?
05/10/2019, 12:32 am - Joshua Akangah: But it is still a ritual/practice done by a specific religion
05/10/2019, 12:32 am - Joshua Akangah: In this case Christians
05/10/2019, 12:32 am - Sebastian 💻: well Akanga and I always watch movies Saturday night, Akanga is no longer with us, but before he left he said we should watch movies to remember him, is that wrong ?
05/10/2019, 12:33 am - Sebastian 💻: Its a practice to remember who we are in relationship with, Humans are prone to forget
05/10/2019, 12:34 am - Joshua Akangah: So you watching movies becomes a practice in reverence to Akangah
05/10/2019, 12:34 am - Sebastian 💻: Infact people who Dont believe I am not so shocked, because even when Christ was on earth there were greater nonbelievers than now 😅
05/10/2019, 12:34 am - Sebastian 💻: Yeah
05/10/2019, 12:35 am - Sebastian 💻: Now is it compulsory to watch movies every Saturday ?
05/10/2019, 12:35 am - Joshua Akangah: There will always be non believers
05/10/2019, 12:35 am - Joshua Akangah: Not necessarily, but it is still a practice
05/10/2019, 12:36 am - Sebastian 💻: Oh yeah
05/10/2019, 12:36 am - Joshua Akangah: What about prayer?
05/10/2019, 12:36 am - Sebastian 💻: Good, not necessary, but then to at least remember Akanga we do that
05/10/2019, 12:36 am - Sebastian 💻: Prayer is communication
05/10/2019, 12:37 am - Joshua Akangah: But i never said the practices to the supreme being are compulsory
05/10/2019, 12:37 am - Joshua Akangah: Which is equal to a practice
05/10/2019, 12:37 am - Sebastian 💻: No I am just stating that because there are religions that emphasize on compulsory practices
05/10/2019, 12:38 am - Sebastian 💻: Is talking a practice ?
05/10/2019, 12:38 am - Joshua Akangah: <Media omitted>
05/10/2019, 12:40 am - Sebastian 💻: You know I once said ignorant humans are the ones who have categorized certain aspect of this 😔
05/10/2019, 12:40 am - Sebastian 💻: They have themselves complicated things that was ment to be simple
05/10/2019, 12:41 am - Joshua Akangah: I still don't get why Christians say it's not a religion
05/10/2019, 12:41 am - Sebastian 💻: This is talking of religion
05/10/2019, 12:41 am - Sebastian 💻: Christianity is not a religion
05/10/2019, 12:43 am - Joshua Akangah: I think it is
05/10/2019, 12:43 am - Sebastian 💻: Hmm, you know Christy came to simplify these things, but then humans still complicated it
05/10/2019, 12:43 am - Joshua Akangah: Humans just explained it
05/10/2019, 12:44 am - Sebastian 💻: In human ignorant understanding
05/10/2019, 12:44 am - Sebastian 💻: Wow, thanks a lot humans
05/10/2019, 12:45 am - Joshua Akangah: Tell me why humans are ignorant. We were created by God, in His own image, and are the best of his creation. So why would we be ignorant?
05/10/2019, 12:47 am - Sebastian 💻: We are ignorant because we have drawn ourselves far from that relationship we have with Him, being in a relation ship with someone there are things you enjoy from that person, not when you are no longer in relationship, those things you Dont enjoy them again
05/10/2019, 12:48 am - Sebastian 💻: But then, Add to your faith, Knowledge, Brotherly kindness, Patience, Long suffering,, that you may grow in the knowledge of Christ
05/10/2019, 12:48 am - Sebastian 💻: Now having faith or believing is one thing, now adding tho your belief, knowledge, is up to you
05/10/2019, 12:49 am - Joshua Akangah: You still don't want to give up erh 😂
05/10/2019, 12:49 am - Sebastian 💻: That's why we still have ignorant Christians, who believe, but have no idea on what they Believe in
05/10/2019, 12:49 am - Sebastian 💻: Because its funny, how people neglect these things
05/10/2019, 12:50 am - Sebastian 💻: There is nothing to give up on, How can I give up on God, when he hasn't given up on me ?
05/10/2019, 12:50 am - Joshua Akangah: Well people always will
05/10/2019, 12:50 am - Sebastian 💻: That's the painful part
05/10/2019, 12:51 am - Joshua Akangah: You can't change it 🤷🏾‍♂
05/10/2019, 12:51 am - Sebastian 💻: Day after day they utter speeches, night after night they speak knowledge
05/10/2019, 12:52 am - Joshua Akangah: You should try arguing with Stanley about religion 😂😂
05/10/2019, 12:52 am - Sebastian 💻: The things created by God, speaking unto us the awesomeness of God, but our eyes have been shifted from those things so we can't see, and our ears have been blocked by wrong things we listen to so we can't hear
05/10/2019, 12:52 am - Sebastian 💻: Oh I have won, the first day we met at the Accra city hotel
05/10/2019, 12:53 am - Sebastian 💻: I told him to explain love to me
05/10/2019, 12:53 am - Sebastian 💻: Is this you saying you are tired ?
05/10/2019, 12:53 am - Joshua Akangah: What did he say
05/10/2019, 12:53 am - Joshua Akangah: Tired of what?
05/10/2019, 12:53 am - Sebastian 💻: Can't really remember again but it was some long discission 😅
05/10/2019, 12:54 am - Joshua Akangah: Then you didn't win 😂
05/10/2019, 12:55 am - Sebastian 💻: If love is chemical reactions in our brain, so its something that comes and goes so you can't believe in that, chemical reaction, well the universe was created from chemical reactions, but you believe that, because you can see it 😂
05/10/2019, 12:55 am - Sebastian 💻: I'll like to have this chat with him, not an argument but a solemn chat, to know why
05/10/2019, 12:55 am - Joshua Akangah: Love is more than just chemical reactions, it's also a psychological and emotional thing
05/10/2019, 12:56 am - Joshua Akangah: No matter what you can't change him
05/10/2019, 12:56 am - Sebastian 💻: That's not up to me
05/10/2019, 12:56 am - Sebastian 💻: That's up to The holy spirit
05/10/2019, 12:56 am - Sebastian 💻: I do pray for him sometimes, that God should gibe him an experience
05/10/2019, 12:56 am - Sebastian 💻: *give
05/10/2019, 12:58 am - Sebastian 💻: Joshua, I'll say this, people who Dont believe have not experienced Christ. When you do, you can't deny it l. Because then you'll see that things of the spirit a are more real than the things we see with our eyes
05/10/2019, 12:58 am - Joshua Akangah: What about Christians who moved?
05/10/2019, 12:59 am - Sebastian 💻: Being a Christian doesn't mean you have experienced Christ
05/10/2019, 12:59 am - Sebastian 💻: Being a Christian is a claim, everyone can say that
05/10/2019, 1:00 am - Joshua Akangah: I've watched videos of people who have been do Christians and have done everything, you can't deny the fact that they had a relationship just because they're now atheist
05/10/2019, 1:01 am - Sebastian 💻: I Dont get you
05/10/2019, 1:02 am - Sebastian 💻: A relationship with Christ is a personal thing, not a group thing or not a thing by confessing that you are a Christian
05/10/2019, 1:02 am - Sebastian 💻: Not by doing what we do
05/10/2019, 1:02 am - Sebastian 💻: Not by going to church and listening to pastors preach
05/10/2019, 1:02 am - Sebastian 💻: Not by joining us in prayers
05/10/2019, 1:02 am - Sebastian 💻: No
05/10/2019, 1:03 am - Sebastian 💻: Its about your personal relationship with Christ, not that this things I have mentioned Dont matter,they do, but they won't profit you if you Dont have a relationship with Christ
05/10/2019, 1:04 am - Joshua Akangah: Search for this guy

26/10/2019, 11:51 am - Joshua Akangah: What did you find?
26/10/2019, 11:51 am - Joshua Akangah: Why aren't I getting anything?? 😩😩
26/10/2019, 11:55 am - Sebastian 💻: Well mow i know how ignorant some people are 😂 based on their opinion
26/10/2019, 11:55 am - Sebastian 💻: Oh chale
26/10/2019, 11:55 am - Sebastian 💻: its not easy ooo
26/10/2019, 11:55 am - Joshua Akangah: Ignorant in what sense?
26/10/2019, 11:55 am - Joshua Akangah: It shall be well
We need women not girls 😂
26/10/2019, 11:56 am - Sebastian 💻: well ignorant "my way of saying i dont understand humans"
26/10/2019, 11:56 am - Sebastian 💻: They say evolution is by natural selection
26/10/2019, 11:56 am - Joshua Akangah: So evolutionists are ignorant or?
26/10/2019, 11:56 am - Joshua Akangah: Yeah
26/10/2019, 11:57 am - Sebastian 💻: They tend to ignore the fact that natural selection  is kind of a theory
26/10/2019, 11:57 am - Joshua Akangah: And what is a theory?
26/10/2019, 11:58 am - Sebastian 💻: Over the years of mankind till now, how many humans have evolved i mean in terms of biological evolution
26/10/2019, 11:58 am - Sebastian 💻: not technological
26/10/2019, 11:59 am - Joshua Akangah: It's a very slow process, it takes billions of years, this we wouldn't be able to observe it
26/10/2019, 11:59 am - Sebastian 💻: and is natural selection a one time thing ? cus we should have also seen development in monkeys evolving into primates
26/10/2019, 11:59 am - Joshua Akangah: But even in nature other animals have gone through evolution and obtained features to adapt to their environment
26/10/2019, 11:59 am - Joshua Akangah: It's happening
Just very slow

It takes BILLIONS AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of years
26/10/2019, 12:00 pm - Sebastian 💻: adaptation, i get. Evolution  through natural selection  i dont get
26/10/2019, 12:00 pm - Sebastian 💻: okay, so some beings evolve by natural selection to adapt while  the other of its spices since they cant adapt, the go extinct right ?
26/10/2019, 12:01 pm - Joshua Akangah: But it is there
Weaker offspring of a species die off 
Only the stronger survive to carry on good genes through generations
Like the saying survival of the fittest
26/10/2019, 12:01 pm - Joshua Akangah: Yeah, also many other factors okay roles in extinction
26/10/2019, 12:01 pm - Sebastian 💻: And here goes this again, if man evolved from apes shouldn't they be extinct
26/10/2019, 12:02 pm - Sebastian 💻: man evolved leaving the weaker apes to die
26/10/2019, 12:02 pm - Joshua Akangah: Nope that's not how it works
26/10/2019, 12:02 pm - Joshua Akangah: Do you know different types of humans were discovered?
26/10/2019, 12:03 pm - Sebastian 💻: Like ?
26/10/2019, 12:04 pm - Sebastian 💻: well evolution  should also explain the developments of Giants ( Huge men in the days of old, kind of like Vikings n stuff) or Goliath  kinda type
26/10/2019, 12:06 pm - Joshua Akangah: https://medium.com/@promit/the-15-types-of-human-species-discovered-till-date-4d1eb036ba46

Read this article, even till date you can find some of these species of humans in different parts of the world. We evolved from these, but they still exist. So if we evolved from apes it makes sense that they still exist
26/10/2019, 12:06 pm - Joshua Akangah: Exactly, those were different species of homo who evolved to adapt to their environment
26/10/2019, 12:08 pm - Joshua Akangah: Also take for example bacteria. How do some bacteria or parasites become resistant to drugs after a time? Do you know that quinine was used to treat malaria years ago? But now it's ineffective. That's because the parasites have evolved a resistance to those drugs. Evolution takes place even on the smallest scales
26/10/2019, 12:08 pm - Sebastian 💻: oh yeahhhhh 👍🏼👍🏼
26/10/2019, 12:08 pm - Sebastian 💻: whoshhhhh🔥
26/10/2019, 12:09 pm - Joshua Akangah: For me even though I'm a Christian I sometimes believe in scientific facts
26/10/2019, 12:11 pm - Sebastian 💻: oh i believe  in science facts
26/10/2019, 12:12 pm - Sebastian 💻: But ut all draws down to they were all designed and unexplainably placed together
26/10/2019, 12:13 pm - Sebastian 💻: You know i got to know that For everything that God creates he assigns laws to those  things
26/10/2019, 12:13 pm - Sebastian 💻: Laws to govern them
26/10/2019, 12:14 pm - Sebastian 💻: For our universe  for example, Designed to be self sustaining
26/10/2019, 12:14 pm - Joshua Akangah: Do you believe that there's life on other planets?
26/10/2019, 12:14 pm - Sebastian 💻: Whereby evolution and all that would be made possible
26/10/2019, 12:15 pm - Sebastian 💻: Well yeah, if Angels fell from Heaven (The unseen world ) to Earth ( The seen world) how can i dispute that fact
26/10/2019, 12:16 pm - Joshua Akangah: But heaven isn't a planet, it's more like a spiritual realm.
I'm talking of other planets like physical
26/10/2019, 12:17 pm - Sebastian 💻: Yeah my definition of Earth is the physical realm
26/10/2019, 12:17 pm - Sebastian 💻: so yeah
26/10/2019, 12:18 pm - Joshua Akangah: So then there's more life out there

But does Christianity account for that life?
26/10/2019, 12:18 pm - Sebastian 💻: Hmm i have met some Christians  who have proven to me why aliens are real
26/10/2019, 12:19 pm - Sebastian 💻: But then i did my own research  and that was when i got my theory that two Reality exists, the unseen and the seen,
26/10/2019, 12:23 pm - Joshua Akangah: But why doesn't Christianity tell us?

In the middle ages the church used to hide things from get followers and persecuted a lot of scientists for trying to bring scientific facts to light, for example proof that the earth was round. 

So since then it's like Christianity and science can't do co exist, it's made like you either choose religion or science.
26/10/2019, 12:28 pm - Sebastian 💻: ikr
26/10/2019, 12:29 pm - Sebastian 💻: you know those people of old were trying to keep what they know to themselves
26/10/2019, 12:29 pm - Sebastian 💻: And in a way they were more intrested in enjoying the physical benefits  rather than wanting to u derstand the things Of God
26/10/2019, 12:30 pm - Sebastian 💻: They saw that if they allwoed their followers to believe in science
26/10/2019, 12:30 pm - Sebastian 💻: that they wont believe in God, meanwhile science is sopposed to help us understand  how Great God is
26/10/2019, 12:31 pm - Sebastian 💻: but then again, they wont want their followers to hear such things
26/10/2019, 12:31 pm - Sebastian 💻: this is why i am always saying Christianity is not a religion, its not a cult or anyother, its a relationship
26/10/2019, 12:32 pm - Joshua Akangah: Do you believe in heaven and hell?
26/10/2019, 12:32 pm - Sebastian 💻: Science  is helping us understand what the Being in whom we are related to has built, but then we are refusing to learn, sticking to just one side of the coin
26/10/2019, 12:33 pm - Sebastian 💻: Yeah
26/10/2019, 12:33 pm - Joshua Akangah: Do you believe all nonbelievers will go to hell?
26/10/2019, 12:34 pm - Joshua Akangah: Even if they live a good life?

17/11/2019, 8:08 am - Joshua Akangah: Why the human race would put value of objects into paper
The type of economy we have adopted isn't good
17/11/2019, 8:09 am - Sebastian 💻: Money itself is a concept
17/11/2019, 8:10 am - Sebastian 💻: Its not the paper we use or the coins, its a concept that we have glibally accepted
17/11/2019, 8:10 am - Sebastian 💻: *globally accepted
17/11/2019, 8:10 am - Joshua Akangah: Yes
Which doesn't make sense
17/11/2019, 8:11 am - Sebastian 💻: Well a concept that allows us to put value on what it is you have to offer in exchange of something of the same value
17/11/2019, 8:11 am - Sebastian 💻: Money ( paper money ) is just a form of value
17/11/2019, 8:11 am - Joshua Akangah: I read some articles about why that isn't good
17/11/2019, 8:12 am - Joshua Akangah: If we continue rolling with money, rich will get richer, poor will get poorer
17/11/2019, 8:12 am - Sebastian 💻: Another thing i have noticed with all these articles, people will say what they want to say
17/11/2019, 8:12 am - Sebastian 💻: That is how ut is, thats not because of money
17/11/2019, 8:13 am - Joshua Akangah: People will say what they want if it is backed by a body of evidence
17/11/2019, 8:13 am - Sebastian 💻: The rich gets richer because of various reasons one of them being they themselves are valuable
17/11/2019, 8:13 am - Joshua Akangah: It's because of the economic model we've adopted
17/11/2019, 8:13 am - Sebastian 💻: Okay give me a vetter idea than money as a means of exchange.....
17/11/2019, 8:13 am - Joshua Akangah: No I disagree
What people use to justify this is that not all humans are the same
But I'm beginning to see that we're close
17/11/2019, 8:13 am - Sebastian 💻: did that article suggest any ?

09/12/2019, 6:28 pm - Joshua Akangah: Would you build this UI with flutter?
09/12/2019, 6:29 pm - Sebastian 💻: naa
09/12/2019, 6:29 pm - Sebastian 💻: React native
09/12/2019, 6:29 pm - Sebastian 💻: ill have someone volunteered to do it
09/12/2019, 6:29 pm - Sebastian 💻: he was the one that insisted i do the design saf
09/12/2019, 6:31 pm - Joshua Akangah: Oh okay
What's your reason for choosing react?
09/12/2019, 6:31 pm - Joshua Akangah: You need to choose the best possible tech for the best possible outcome
Not saying react isn't good
09/12/2019, 6:31 pm - Sebastian 💻: Well react native is kinda like flutter too,works for both platforms and is widely used
09/12/2019, 6:32 pm - Sebastian 💻: whilst flutter is used by some,and not yet addopted widely
09/12/2019, 6:32 pm - Joshua Akangah: Which framework gives the best performance?
09/12/2019, 6:32 pm - Sebastian 💻: so it would be hard finding another  flutter dev to continue or to fix stuff in the code
09/12/2019, 6:32 pm - Sebastian 💻: Now ill have to go with react native
09/12/2019, 6:33 pm - Joshua Akangah: Oh okay I see
09/12/2019, 6:33 pm - Sebastian 💻: flutter cant do a lot yet, cus its still new, and besides the guy is one of the best devs here at work so he would do it nicely
09/12/2019, 6:34 pm - Joshua Akangah: How long will it take?
09/12/2019, 6:35 pm - Sebastian 💻: Funny, he said he would start fbuary
09/12/2019, 6:35 pm - Sebastian 💻: so now ill have to fix the old app we have
09/12/2019, 6:35 pm - Joshua Akangah: Yikes
09/12/2019, 6:35 pm - Joshua Akangah: He's volunteering right?
09/12/2019, 6:35 pm - Sebastian 💻: yeah

12/12/2019, 1:23 pm - Sebastian 💻: then he would code it
12/12/2019, 1:23 pm - Sebastian 💻: give it to either you or mike, for backend
12/12/2019, 1:24 pm - Sebastian 💻: then push to production
12/12/2019, 1:24 pm - Sebastian 💻: but the UI would be ready by next friday
12/12/2019, 1:24 pm - Sebastian 💻: meaning he would start work next saturday

12/12/2019, 1:25 pm - Sebastian 💻: so from now till then, what do you guys do ? mike is done with the api, so i am seeing if we can get to link it to the mobile app, so we move with that

12/12/2019, 1:26 pm - Joshua Akangah: I'm waiting for your command, if APIs are ready, then just tell me what I have to do. But then we all have to discuss this one
